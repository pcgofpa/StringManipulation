# StringManipulation

Assignment Details
Scenario: You need to build the mobile app that can accept two strings and displays the output based on the button pushed.
For example:
String 1 = "Hello";
String 2 = "World."

Once the user clicks the Add Strings button, then the output should be Hello World. 

Add a button in the UI that compares String 1 and String 2

Add a button to count the total number of vowels occuring in String 1 and String 2

This was assigned to me in my mobile development course.
